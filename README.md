# Interfacing-a-7-segment-display-with-Arduino.
Displaying number 0-9 on a 7-segment display in sequence, controlled by a push button.

  To build the circuit, firstly we place all the components onto the breadboard. Then, wires are used to connect all of the display's legs to Arduinoâ€™s pins. On the cathode leg, connect it to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
  
  Next, the push button is connected to one pin and the other leg on the same side to a ground pin.
  
  Lastly, connect the Arduino board to a computer via a USB cable to upload a code we've programmed in Arduino IDE into the Arduino board and you're good to go!
